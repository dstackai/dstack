`dstack` is an open-source alternative to Kubernetes and Slurm, designed to simplify GPU allocation and AI workload
orchestration for ML teams across top clouds and on-prem clusters.

#### Accelerators

`dstack` supports `NVIDIA`, `AMD`, `Google TPU`, and `Intel Gaudi` accelerators out of the box.

## Installation

> Before using `dstack` through CLI or API, set up a `dstack` server. If you already have a running `dstack` server, you only need to [set up the CLI](#set-up-the-cli).

### Set up the server

#### (Optional) Configure backends

To use `dstack` with cloud providers, configure backends
via the `~/.dstack/server/config.yml` file.

For more details on how to configure backends, check [Backends](https://dstack.ai/docs/concepts/backends).

> For using `dstack` with on-prem servers, create [SSH fleets](https://dstack.ai/docs/concepts/fleets#ssh) 
> once the server is up.

#### Start the server

You can install the server on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL 2). It requires Git and
OpenSSH.

##### pip

```shell
$ pip install "dstack[all]" -U
```

##### uv

```shell
$ uv tool install "dstack[all]" -U
```

Once it's installed, go ahead and start the server.

```shell
$ dstack server
Applying ~/.dstack/server/config.yml...

The admin token is "bbae0f28-d3dd-4820-bf61-8f4bb40815da"
The server is running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

For more details on server configuration options, see the
[Server deployment](https://dstack.ai/docs/guides/server-deployment) guide.

### Set up the CLI

Once the server is up, you can access it via the `dstack` CLI. 

The CLI can be installed on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It requires Git and OpenSSH.

##### pip

```shell
$ pip install dstack -U
```

##### uv

```shell
$ uv tool install dstack -U
```

To point the CLI to the `dstack` server, configure it
with the server address, user token, and project name:

```shell
$ dstack config \
    --url http://127.0.0.1:3000 \
    --project main \
    --token bbae0f28-d3dd-4820-bf61-8f4bb40815da
    
Configuration is updated at ~/.dstack/config.yml
```

## How does it work?

### 1. Define configurations

`dstack` supports the following configurations:
   
* [Dev environments](https://dstack.ai/docs/dev-environments) &mdash; for interactive development using a desktop IDE
* [Tasks](https://dstack.ai/docs/tasks) &mdash; for scheduling jobs (incl. distributed jobs) or running web apps
* [Services](https://dstack.ai/docs/services) &mdash; for deployment of models and web apps (with auto-scaling and authorization)
* [Fleets](https://dstack.ai/docs/fleets) &mdash; for managing cloud and on-prem clusters
* [Volumes](https://dstack.ai/docs/concepts/volumes) &mdash; for managing persisted volumes
* [Gateways](https://dstack.ai/docs/concepts/gateways) &mdash; for configuring the ingress traffic and public endpoints

Configuration can be defined as YAML files within your repo.

### 2. Apply configurations

Apply the configuration either via the `dstack apply` CLI command or through a programmatic API.

`dstack` automatically manages provisioning, job queuing, auto-scaling, networking, volumes, run failures,
out-of-capacity errors, port-forwarding, and more &mdash; across clouds and on-prem clusters.
