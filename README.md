`dstack` is a lightweight alternative to Kubernetes, designed specifically for managing the development, training, and
deployment of AI models at any scale.

`dstack` is easy to use with any cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI, Lambda, TensorDock, Vast.ai, RunPod, etc.) or
any on-prem clusters.

If you already use Kubernetes, `dstack` can be used with it.

#### Accelerators

`dstack` supports `NVIDIA GPU`, `AMD GPU`, and `Google Cloud TPU` out of the box.

## Installation

Before using `dstack` through CLI or API, set up a `dstack` server.

### 1. Configure backends

If you want the `dstack` server to run containers or manage clusters in your cloud accounts (or use Kubernetes),
create the [`~/.dstack/server/config.yml`](https://dstack.ai/docs/reference/server/config.yml.md) file and configure backends.

### 2. Start the server

Once the `~/.dstack/server/config.yml` file is configured, proceed to start the server:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ pip install "dstack[all]" -U
$ dstack server

Applying ~/.dstack/server/config.yml...

The admin token is "bbae0f28-d3dd-4820-bf61-8f4bb40815da"
The server is running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

</div>

> **Note**
> It's also possible to run the server via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/dstackai/dstack).

The `dstack` server can run anywhere: on your laptop, a dedicated server, or in the cloud. Once it's up, you
can use either the CLI or the API.

### 3. Set up the CLI

To point the CLI to the `dstack` server, configure it
with the server address, user token, and project name:

```shell
$ pip install dstack
$ dstack config --url http://127.0.0.1:3000 \
    --project main \
    --token bbae0f28-d3dd-4820-bf61-8f4bb40815da
    
Configuration is updated at ~/.dstack/config.yml
```

### 4. Create on-prem fleets
    
> If you want the `dstack` server to run containers on your on-prem servers,
use [fleets](../fleets.md#__tabbed_1_2).

## How does it work?

> Before using `dstack`, [install](https://dstack.ai/docs/installation/index.md) the server and configure backends.

### 1. Define configurations

`dstack` supports the following configurations:
   
* [Dev environments](https://dstack.ai/docs/dev-environments.md) &mdash; for interactive development using a desktop IDE
* [Tasks](https://dstack.ai/docs/tasks.md) &mdash; for scheduling jobs (incl. distributed jobs) or running web apps
* [Services](https://dstack.ai/docs/services.md) &mdash; for deployment of models and web apps (with auto-scaling and authorization)
* [Fleets](https://dstack.ai/docs/fleets.md) &mdash; for managing cloud and on-prem clusters
* [Volumes](https://dstack.ai/docs/concepts/volumes.md) &mdash; for managing persisted volumes
* [Gateways](https://dstack.ai/docs/concepts/volumes.md) &mdash; for configuring the ingress traffic and public endpoints

Configuration can be defined as YAML files within your repo.

### 2. Apply configurations

Apply the configuration either via the `dstack apply` CLI command or through a programmatic API.

`dstack` automatically manages provisioning, job queuing, auto-scaling, networking, volumes, run failures,
out-of-capacity errors, port-forwarding, and more &mdash; across clouds and on-prem clusters.
