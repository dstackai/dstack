dstack allows you to train models and run AI apps in your cloud account.

* Define your machine learning tasks as workflows, and run them via the CLI. 
* Specify hardware requirements for your workflows as code.
* Deploy AI applications to dstack with a single command.
* Store, version, and reuse data the most simple way.
* Launch pre-configured development environments with a single command.

This repository contains the open source code of the built-in [providers](src/dstack/providers), the [CLI](src/dstack), and [documentation](docs). 

## üìò Documentation

See full documentation at [docs.dstack.ai](https://docs.dstack.ai)

## üöÄ Getting started

To use dstack, you have to [create an account](https://dstack.ai/signup), and 
obtain your personal token.

### Install the CLI

Here's how to do it:

```bash
pip install dstack
dstack config --token <token> 
```

### Define workflows

Your common project tasks can be defined as workflows:

<details>
<summary>Click to see an example</summary>

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: prepare
    help: "Loads and prepares the training data" 
    provider: python
    file: "prepare.py"
    artifacts: ["data"]

  - name: train
    help: "Trains a model and saves the checkpoints"
    depends-on:
      - prepare:latest
    provider: python
    file: "train.py"
    artifacts: ["checkpoint"]
    resources:
      gpu: 1    
```
</details>

Run any workflow in the cloud via a single command:

```bash
$ dstack run train
```

Workflows are optional. You can run providers directly from the CLI:

```bash
dstack run python train.py \
  --dep prepare:latest --artifact checkpoint --gpu 1
```

### Run applications

Here's how to run applications:

```bash
dstack run streamlit app.py --dep model:latest
```

### Launch dev environments

If you need an interactive dev environment, you can have it too through the corresponding provider:

```bash
dstack run code app.py --dep prepare:latest --gpu 1
```

This will run a VS Code with mounted artifacts and requested hardware resources.
