# dstack 0.20 GA: Fleet-first UX and other important changes

We’re releasing `dstack` 0.20.0, a major update that improves how teams orchestrate GPU workloads for development, training, and inference. Most `dstack` updates are incremental and backward compatible, but this version introduces a few major changes to how you work with `dstack`.

In `dstack` 0.20.0, fleets are now a first-class concept, giving you more explicit control over how GPU capacity is provisioned and managed. We’ve also added *Events*, which record important system activity—such as scheduling decisions, run status changes, and resource lifecycle updates—so it’s easier to understand what’s happening without digging through server logs.

This post goes through the changes in detail and explains how to upgrade and migrate your existing setup.

## Fleets

In earlier versions, submitting a run that didn’t match any existing fleet would cause `dstack` to automatically create one. While this reduced setup overhead, it also made capacity provisioning implicit and less predictable.

With `dstack` 0.20.0, fleets must be created explicitly and treated as first-class resources. This shift makes capacity provisioning declarative, improving control over resource limits, instance lifecycles, and overall fleet behavior.

For users who previously relied on auto-created fleets, similar behavior can be achieved by defining an elastic fleet, for example:

<div editor-title="fleet.dstack.yml">
    
    ```yaml
    type: fleet
    # The name is optional, if not specified, generated randomly
    name: default
    
    # Can be a range or a fixed number
    # Allow to provision up to 2 instances
    nodes: 0..2

    # Uncomment to ensure instances are inter-connected
    #placement: cluster

    # Deprovision instances above the minimum if they remain idle
    idle_duration: 1h
    
    resources:
      # Allow to provision up to 8 GPUs
      gpu: 0..8
    ```
    
</div>

If the `nodes` range starts above `0`, `dstack` provisions the initial capacity upfront and scales additional instances on demand, enabling more predictable capacity planning.

When a run does not explicitly reference a fleet (via the [`fleets`](../../docs/reference/dstack.yml/dev-environment.md#fleets) property), `dstack` automatically selects one that satisfies the run’s requirements.

## Events

Previously, when `dstack` changed the state of a run or other resource, that information was written only to the server logs. This worked for admins, but it made it hard for users to understand what happened or why.

Starting with version `0.20.0`, `dstack` exposes these events directly to users.

Each resource now includes an `Events` tab in the UI, showing related events in real time:

There is also a dedicated `Events` page that aggregates events across resources. You can filter by project, user, run, or job to quickly narrow down what you’re looking for:

The same information is available through the CLI:

This makes it easier to track state changes, debug issues, and review past actions without needing access to server logs.

## Runs

This release updates several defaults related to run configuration. The goal is to reduce implicit assumptions and make it more convenient.

### Working directory

Previously, the `working_dir` property defaulted to `/workflow`. Now, the default working directory is always taken from the Docker image.

The working directory in the default Docker images (if you don't specify `image`) is now set to `/dstack/run`.

### Repo directory

Previously, if you didn't specify a repo path, the repo was cloned to `/workflow`. Now, in that case the repo will be cloned to the working directory.

<div editor-title="examples/.dstack.yml"> 

```yaml
type: dev-environment
name: vscode    

repos:
  # Clones the repo from the parent directory (`examples/..`) to `<working dir>`
  - ..

ide: vscode
```

</div>

Also, now if the repo directory is not empty, the run will fail with an error.

## Backward compatibility

While the update introduces breaking changes, 0.19.* CLIs remain compatible with 0.20.* servers.

> Note, the 0.20.* CLI only works with a 0.20.* server.

!!! warning "Breaking changes"
    This release introduces breaking changes that may affect existing setups. Before upgrading either the CLI or the server, review the [migration guide](https://dstack.ai/docs/guides/migration/#0_20).
