# Monitoring GPU usage and other container metrics

## How it works { style="display:none"}

While it's possible to use third-party monitoring tools with `dstack`, it is often more convenient to debug your run and
track metrics out of the box. That's why, with the latest release, `dstack` introduced [`dstack stats`](../../docs/reference/cli#dstack-stats), a new CLI (and API)
for monitoring container metrics, including GPU usage for `NVIDIA`, `AMD`, and other accelerators.

The command is similar to `kubectl top` (in terms of semantics) and `docker stats` (in terms of the CLI interface). The key
difference is that `dstack stats` includes GPU VRAM usage and GPU utilization percentage. 

>The feature works right away with `NVIDIA` and `AMD`, whether you're running a development environment, task, or service.
> `TPU` support is coming soon.

Similar to `kubectl top`, if a run consists of multiple jobs (such as distributed training or an auto-scalable service),
`dstack stats` will display metrics per job.

!!! info "REST API"
    In addition to the `dstack stats` CLI commands, metrics can be obtained via the
    [`/api/project/{project_name}/metrics/job/{run_name}`](../../docs/reference/api/rest/#operations-tag-metrics) REST endpoint.

## Why monitor GPU usage

Kubernetes and Docker donâ€™t offer built-in support for GPU usage tracking. Since `dstack` is tailored for AI containers, we
consider native GPU monitoring essential. 

#### GPU  usage

Monitoring GPU memory usage in AI workloads helps prevent out-of-memory errors and provides a clearer picture of how
much memory is actually used or needed by the workload.

#### GPU utilization

Monitoring GPU utilization is important for identifying under-utilization and ensuring that workloads are distributed
evenly across GPUs.

## Roadmap

Monitoring is a critical part of observability, and we have many more features on our roadmap:

* Potentially adding more metrics, including disk usage, I/O, network, etc
* Support for the TPU accelerator
* Displaying historical metrics within the control plane UI
* Tracking deployment metrics, including LLM-related metrics
* A simple way to export metrics to Prometheus
