# Supporting MPI and NCCL/RCCL tests 

As AI models grow in complexity, efficient orchestration tools become increasingly important. 
[Fleets](../../docs/concepts/fleets.md) introduced by `dstack` last year streamline 
[task execution](../../docs/concepts/tasks.md) on both cloud and 
on-prem clusters, whether it's pre-training, fine-tuning, or batch processing.

The strength of `dstack` lies in its flexibility. Users can leverage distributed framework like
`torchrun`, `accelerate`, or others. `dstack` handles node provisioning, job execution, and automatically propagates
system environment variables—such as `DSTACK_NODE_RANK`, `DSTACK_MASTER_NODE_IP`,
`DSTACK_GPUS_PER_NODE` and [others](../../docs/concepts/tasks.md#system-environment-variables)—to containers.

One use case `dstack` hasn’t supported until now is MPI, as it requires a scheduled environment or
direct SSH connections between containers. Since `mpirun` is essential for running NCCL/RCCL tests—crucial for large-scale
cluster usage—we’ve added support for it.

Below is an example of a task that runs AllReduce test on 2 nodes, each with 4 GPUs (8 processes in total).

<div editor-title="examples/misc/nccl-tests/.dstack.yml">

```yaml
type: task
name: nccl-tests

nodes: 2

image: dstackai/efa
env:
  - NCCL_DEBUG=INFO
commands:
  - |
    # We use FIFO for inter-node communication
    FIFO=/tmp/dstack_job
    if [ ${DSTACK_NODE_RANK} -eq 0 ]; then
      cd /root/nccl-tests/build
      # Generate hostfile for mpirun
      : > hostfile
      for ip in ${DSTACK_NODES_IPS}; do
        echo "${ip} slots=${DSTACK_GPUS_PER_NODE}" >> hostfile
      done
      MPIRUN='mpirun --allow-run-as-root --hostfile hostfile'
      # Wait for other nodes
      while true; do
        if ${MPIRUN} -n ${DSTACK_NODES_NUM} -N 1 true >/dev/null 2>&1; then
          break
        fi
        echo 'Waiting for nodes...'
        sleep 5
      done
      # Run NCCL tests
      ${MPIRUN} \
        -n ${DSTACK_GPUS_NUM} -N ${DSTACK_GPUS_PER_NODE} \
        --mca pml ^cm \
        --mca btl tcp,self \
        --mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,docker0 \
        --bind-to none \
        ./all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 8G -f 2 -g 1
      # Notify nodes the job is done
      ${MPIRUN} -n ${DSTACK_NODES_NUM} -N 1 sh -c "echo done > ${FIFO}"
    else
      mkfifo ${FIFO}
      # Wait for a message from the first node
      cat ${FIFO}
    fi

The first worker node (`DSTACK_NODE_RANK=0`) generates a `hostfile` listing all node IPs and waits until all nodes are
reachable via MPI. Once confirmed, it launches the `/root/nccl-tests/build/all_reduce_perf` benchmark across all available GPUs in the cluster.

The other worker nodes remain blocked until they receive a termination signal from the master node via a FIFO pipe.

With this, now you can use such a task to run both NCCL or RCCL tests on both cloud and SSH fleets, 
as well as use MPI for other tasks.
