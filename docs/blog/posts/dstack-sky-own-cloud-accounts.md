# dstack Sky now allows using your own cloud accounts

[dstack Sky :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://sky.dstack.ai){:target="_blank"} 
enables you to access GPUs from the global marketplace at the most
competitive rates. However, sometimes you may want to use your own cloud accounts. 
With today's release, both options are now supported.

### Configure backends

To use your own cloud account, open the project settings and edit the corresponding backend.

You can configure your cloud accounts for any of the supported providers, including AWS, GCP, Azure, TensorDock, Lambda,
CUDO, RunPod, and Vast.ai.

Additionally, you can disable certain backends if you do not plan to use them.

Typically, if you prefer using your own cloud accounts, it's recommended that you use the 
[open-source version :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack/){:target="_blank"} of `dstack`.
However, if you prefer not to host it yourself, now you can use `dstack Sky` 
with your own cloud accounts as well.
