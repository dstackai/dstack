# Supporting NVIDIA and AMD accelerators on Vultr

As demand for AI infrastructure grows, the need for efficient, vendor-neutral orchestration tools is becoming
increasingly important.
At `dstack`, we’re committed to redefining AI container orchestration by prioritizing an AI-native, open-source-first
approach.
Today, we’re excited to share a new integration and partnership
with [Vultr :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://www.vultr.com/){:target="_blank"}.

This new integration enables Vultr customers to train and deploy models on both AMD
and NVIDIA GPUs with greater flexibility and efficiency–using `dstack`.

## About Vultr

[Vultr :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://www.vultr.com/){:target="_blank"} provides cloud GPUs across 32 regions, supporting both NVIDIA and AMD hardware with on-demand and reserved
capacity. Their offerings include AMD MI300X and NVIDIA GH200, H200, H100, A100, L40S, and A40, all available at
competitive [pricing :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://www.vultr.com/pricing/#cloud-gpu){:target="_blank"}.

## Why dstack

Kubernetes wasn’t built for AI. It’s powerful, but it adds unnecessary complexity that slows down development, training,
and deployment. That’s where `dstack` comes in.

`dstack` is an open-source orchestrator designed specifically for AI. Here’s a quick look at how it simplifies running dev
environments and services on Vultr:

`dstack` runs on any cloud or on-prem setup, providing a simple way to manage dev environments, tasks, services, fleets,
and volumes—so you can focus on building instead of troubleshooting infrastructure.

## Getting started

To use `dstack` with your Vultr account, you need to [configure a `vultr` backend](../../docs/concepts/backends.md):

Log into your [Vultr :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://www.vultr.com/) account, click `Account` in the sidebar, select `API`, find the `Personal Access Token` panel and click the `Enable API` button. In the `Access Control` panel, allow API requests from all addresses or from the subnet where your `dstack` server is deployed.

Then, go ahead and configure the backend:

<div editor-title="~/.dstack/server/config.yml">

```yaml
projects:
  - name: main
    backends:
      - type: vultr
        creds:
          type: api_key
          api_key: B57487240a466624b48de22865589
```

</div>
