Configuring your TensorDock account with `dstack` is very easy. Simply generate an authorization key in your TensorDock
API settings and set it up in `~/.dstack/server/config.yml`:

<div editor-title="~/.dstack/server/config.yml">

```yaml
projects:
- name: main
  backends:
  - type: tensordock
    creds:
      type: api_key
      api_key: 248e621d-9317-7494-dc1557fa5825b-98b
      api_token: FyBI3YbnFEYXdth2xqYRnQI7hiusssBC
```

</div>

Now you can restart the server and proceed to using the CLI or API for running development environments, tasks, and services.

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack run . -f .dstack.yml --gpu 40GB
