# Stable Diffusion with Diffusers

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use the [`diffusers`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) library to generate images using 
a pretrained Stable Diffusion model.

!!! info "NOTE:"
    The source code for this tutorial can be located in [`github.com/dstack-examples`](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack-examples/tree/main/stable_diffusion).

## Requirements

Here is the list of Python libraries that we will utilize:

```txt
diffusers
transformers
scipy
ftfy
accelerate
safetensors
```

!!! info "NOTE:"
    We're using the [`safetensors`](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) library because it implements a new simple format for storing tensors safely (as opposed
    to pickle) and that is still fast (zero-copy).

To ensure our scripts can run smoothly across all environments, let's include them in
the `stable_diffusion/requirements.txt` file.

You can also install these libraries locally:

```shell
pip install -r stable_diffusion/requirements.txt
```

Also, because we'll use `dstack` CLI, let's install it locally:

```shell
pip install dstack -U
```

## Download the pre-trained model

In our tutorial, we'll use the [`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) model (pretrained by Runway).

Let's create the following `stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion.py` file:

```python
import shutil

from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline


def main():
    _, cache_folder = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
                                                              return_cached_folder=True)
    shutil.copytree(cache_folder, "./models/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", dirs_exist_ok=True)
```

!!! info "NOTE:"
    By default, `diffusers` downloads the model to its own [cache folder](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/cache) built using symlinks.
    Since `dstack` [doesn't support symlinks](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack/issues/180) in artifacts, we're copying the model files to the local `models` folder. 

In order to run a script via `dstack`, the script must be defined as a workflow via a YAML file
under `.dstack/workflows`.

Let's define the following `.dstack/workflows/stable_diffusion.yaml` file:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: stable-diffusion
    provider: bash
    commands:
      - pip install -r stable_diffusion/requirements.txt
      - python stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion.py
    artifacts:
      - path: ./models
    resources:
      memory: 16GB
```

Now, the workflow can be run anywhere via the `dstack` CLI.

!!! info "NOTE:"
    Before you run a workflow via `dstack`, make sure your project has a remote Git branch configured,
    and invoke the `dstack init` command which will ensure that `dstack` may access the repository:
    ```shell
    dstack init
    ```

Here's how to run a `dstack` workflow locally:

```shell
dstack run stable-diffusion
```

Once you run it, `dstack` will run the script, and save the `models` folder as an artifact.
After that, you can reuse it in other workflows.

## Attach an interactive IDE

Sometimes, before you can run a workflow, you may want to run code interactively,
e.g. via an IDE or a notebook.

Look at the following example:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: code-stable
    provider: code
    deps:
      - workflow: stable-diffusion
    setup:
      - pip install -r stable_diffusion/requirements.txt
    resources:
      memory: 16GB
```

As you see, the `code-stable` workflow refers the `stable-diffusion` workflow as a dependency.

If you run it, `dstack` will run a VS Code application with the code, pretrained model,
and Python environment:

```shell 
dstack run code-stable
```

## Generate images

Let's write a script that generates images using a pre-trained model and given prompts.

Here's an example of the `stable_diffusion/prompt_stable.py` file:

```python
import argparse
from pathlib import Path

import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("-P", "--prompt", action='append', required=True)
    args = parser.parse_args()

    pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("./models/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", local_files_only=True)
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        pipe.to("cuda")
    images = pipe(args.prompt).images

    output = Path("./output")
    output.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    for i in range(len(images)):
        images[i].save(output / f"{i}.png")
```

The script loads the model from the local `models` folder, generates images and saves them to the 
local `output` folder.

To be able to run it via `dstack`, let's define it in `.dstack/workflows/stable_diffusion.yaml`:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: prompt-stable
    provider: bash
    deps:
      - workflow: stable-diffusion
    commands:
      - pip install -r stable_diffusion/requirements.txt
      - python stable_diffusion/prompt_stable.py ${{ run.args }}
    artifacts:
      - path: ./output
    resources:
      memory: 16GB
```

!!! info "NOTE:"
    The `dstack run` command allows to pass arguments to the workflow via `${{ run.args }}`.

Let's run the workflow locally:

```shell
dstack run prompt-stable -P "cats in hats" 
```

The output artifacts of local runs are stored under `~/.dstack/artifacts`.

Here's an example of the `prompt-stable` workflow output:

![cats in hats](cats-in-hats.png)

## Configure a remote

By default, workflows in `dstack` run locally. However, you have the option to configure a `remote` to run your
workflows.
For instance, you can set up your AWS account as a `remote` to execute workflows.

To configure a `remote`, run the following command:

```shell
dstack config
```

This command prompts you to select an AWS profile for credentials, an AWS region for workflow execution, and an S3
bucket to store remote artifacts.

```shell
AWS profile: default
AWS region: eu-west-1
S3 bucket: dstack-142421590066-eu-west-1
EC2 subnet: none
```

## Run workflows remotely

Once a remote is configured, you can use the `--remote` flag with the `dstack run` command
to run workflows remotely.

Let's first run the `stable-diffusion` workflow:

```shell
dstack run stable-diffusion --remote
```

!!! info "NOTE:"
    When you run a remote workflow, `dstack` automatically creates resources in the configured cloud,
    and releases them once the workflow is finished.

Now, you can run the `prompt-stable` remotely as well:

```shell
dstack run prompt-stable --remote --gpu-name V100 -P "cats in hats"
```

!!! info "NOTE:"
    You can configure the required resources to run the workflows either via the `resources` property in YAML
    or the `dstack run` command's arguments, such as `--gpu`, `--gpu-name`, etc.
