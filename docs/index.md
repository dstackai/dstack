# Reproducible ML workflows

`dstack` is an open-source tool that allows running reproducible ML workflows independently of
infrastructure. It allows running ML workflows locally or remotely, using any configured cloud vendor. 
Additionally, `dstack` facilitates versioning and reuse of artifacts (such as data and models), across teams.

In brief, `dstack` simplifies the process of establishing ML training pipelines that are independent of a
particular vendor and facilitates collaboration within teams on data and models.

[//]: # (### How it works)

[//]: # (* Define workflows via YAML)
[//]: # (* Run workflows locally via CLI)
[//]: # (* Reuse artifacts &#40;data and models&#41; across workflows)
[//]: # (* Run workflows remotely &#40;in any configured cloud&#41; via CLI)
[//]: # (* Share artifacts &#40;data and models&#41; across teams)

[//]: # (TODO: Later, tell something about managing teams, quotes, etc)

### Get started in 30 min

Having your first ML workflows up and running will take less than 30 min.
