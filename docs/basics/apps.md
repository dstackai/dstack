# Apps

!!! info "NOTE:"
    The source code for the examples below can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack-examples).

Both the [`bash`](../reference/providers/index.md#bash) and [`docker`](../reference/providers/index.md#docker) providers 
allow workflows to host applications. To host apps within a workflow, you have to request the number of ports that your apps need. 
Use the `ports` property for that.

The actual port numbers will be passes to the workflow via environment variables `PORT_0`, `PORT_1`, etc.

The workflow below launches a FastAPI application:

=== "`.dstack/workflows/apps.yaml`"

    ```yaml
    workflows:
      - name: hello-fastapi
        provider: bash
        ports: 1
        commands:
          - pip install fastapi uvicorn
          - uvicorn apps.hello_fastapi:app --port $PORT_0 --host 0.0.0.0
    ```

=== "`apps/hello_fastapi.py`"

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()
    
    
    @app.get("/")
    async def root():
        return {"message": "Hello World"}
    ```

!!! info "NOTE:" 
    Don't forget to bind your application to the `0.0.0.0` hostname.
