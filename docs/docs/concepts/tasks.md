# Tasks

Tasks allow for convenient scheduling of various batch jobs, such as training, fine-tuning, or
data processing. They can also be used to run web applications
when features offered by [services](services.md) are not needed, such as for debugging.

You can run tasks on a single machine or on a cluster of nodes.

## Configuration

First, create a YAML file in your project folder. Its name must end with `.dstack.yml` (e.g. `.dstack.yml` or `train.dstack.yml`
are both acceptable).

<div editor-title="train.dstack.yml"> 

```yaml
type: task

python: "3.11"
env:
  - HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1
commands:
  - pip install -r fine-tuning/qlora/requirements.txt
  - tensorboard --logdir results/runs &
  - python fine-tuning/qlora/train.py
ports:
  - 6000

# (Optional) Configure `gpu`, `memory`, `disk`, etc
resources:
  gpu: 80GB
```

</div>

If you don't specify your Docker image, `dstack` uses the [base](https://hub.docker.com/r/dstackai/base/tags) image
(pre-configured with Python, Conda, and essential CUDA drivers).


!!! info "Distributed tasks"
    By default, tasks run on a single instance. However, you can specify
    the [number of nodes](../reference/dstack.yml/task.md#_nodes).
    In this case, `dstack` provisions a cluster of instances.

!!! info "Reference"
    See the [.dstack.yml reference](../reference/dstack.yml/task.md)
    for all supported configuration options and multiple examples.

## Running

To run a configuration, use the [`dstack run`](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-run) command followed by the working directory path, 
configuration file path, and other options.

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack run . -f train.dstack.yml

```

</div>

If the task specifies `ports`, `dstack run` automatically forwards them to your local machine for
convenient and secure access.

When running the task, `dstack run` mounts the current folder's contents.

!!! info ".gitignore"
    If there are large files or folders you'd like to avoid uploading, 
    you can list them in `.gitignore`.

!!! info "Reference"
    See the [CLI reference](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-run) for more details
    on how `dstack run` works.

## Managing runs

**Stoping runs**

Once you use [`dstack stop`](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-stop) (or when the run exceeds the
`max_duration`), the instances return to the [pool](pools.md).

**Listing runs**

The [`dstack ps`](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-ps) command lists all running runs and their status.
