### Idle duration

If a run provisions a new instance, the instance stays `idle` for 5 minutes by default and can be reused within that time.
If the instance is not reused within this period, it is automatically terminated.
To change the default idle duration, set
[`idle_duration`](../reference/dstack.yml/fleet.md#idle_duration) in the run configuration (e.g., `0s`, `1m`, or `off` for unlimited).
