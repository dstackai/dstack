### Idle duration

If the run is submitted to a fleet with `nodes` set to a range and a new instance is provisioned,
the shorter of the fleet's and run's `idle_duration` is used.
If the run reuses an existing fleet instance, only the fleet's
[`idle_duration`](../reference/dstack.yml/fleet.md#idle_duration) applies.

If an instance remains `idle`, it is automatically terminated after `idle_duration`.

> Not applied for container-based backends (Kubernetes, Vast.ai, RunPod).
