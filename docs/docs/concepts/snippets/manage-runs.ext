## Manage runs

### List runs

The [`dstack ps`](../reference/cli/dstack/ps.md)  command lists all running jobs and their statuses.
Use `--watch` (or `-w`) to monitor the live status of runs.

### Stop a run

A dev environment runs until you stop it or its lifetime exceeds [`max_duration`](../reference/dstack.yml/dev-environment.md#max_duration).
To gracefully stop a dev environment, use [`dstack stop`](../reference/cli/dstack/stop.md).
Pass `--abort` or `-x` to stop without waiting for a graceful shutdown.

### Attach to a run

By default, `dstack apply` runs in attached mode â€“ it establishes the SSH tunnel to the run, forwards ports, and shows real-time logs.
If you detached from a run, you can reattach to it using [`dstack attach`](../reference/cli/dstack/attach.md).

### See run logs

To see the logs of a run without attaching, use [`dstack logs`](../reference/cli/dstack/logs.md).
Pass `--diagnose`/`-d` to `dstack logs` to see the diagnostics logs. It may be useful if a run fails.
For more information on debugging failed runs, see the [troubleshooting](../guides/troubleshooting.md) guide.
