# Gateways

Gateways handle the ingress traffic of running services.
They provide [services](services.md) with HTTPS domains, handle authentication, distribute load, and perform auto-scaling.
In order to run a service, you need to have at least one gateway set up.

!!! info "dstack Sky"
    If you're using [dstack Sky :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://sky.dstack.ai){:target="_blank"},
    the gateway is already set up for you.

## Configuration

First, create a YAML file in your project folder. Its name must end with `.dstack.yml` (e.g. `.dstack.yml` or `gateway.dstack.yml`
are both acceptable).

<div editor-title="gateway.dstack.yml"> 

```yaml
type: gateway
name: example-gateway

backend: aws
region: eu-west-1
domain: example.com
```

</div>

A domain name is required to create a gateway.

!!! info "Reference"
    See the [.dstack.yml reference](../reference/dstack.yml/gateway.md)
    for all supported configuration options and examples.

## Creating and updating gateways

To create or update the gateway, simply call the [`dstack apply`](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-apply) command:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack apply . -f examples/deployment/gateway.dstack.yml

The example-gateway doesn't exist. Create it? [y/n]: y

 BACKEND  REGION     NAME             HOSTNAME  DOMAIN       DEFAULT  STATUS
 aws      eu-west-1  example-gateway            example.com  âœ“        submitted

```

</div>

## Updating DNS records

Once the gateway is assigned a hostname, go to your domain's DNS settings
and add an `A` DNS record for `*.<gateway domain>` (e.g., `*.example.com`) pointing to the gateway's hostname.

This will allow you to access runs and models using this domain.

## Managing gateways

**Deleting gateways**

To delete a gateway, pass gateway configuration to [`dstack delete`](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-delete):

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack delete . -f examples/deployment/gateway.dstack.yml
```

</div>

**Listing gateways**

The [`dstack gateway list`](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-gateway-list) command lists existing gateways and their status.
