# Fleets

Fleets enable efficient provisioning and management of clusters and instances, both in the cloud and on-prem. Once a
fleet is created, it can be reused by dev environments, tasks, and services.

## Define a configuration

To create a fleet, create a YAML file in your project folder. Its name must end with `.dstack.yml` (e.g. `.dstack.yml` or `fleet.dstack.yml`
are both acceptable).

=== "Cloud fleets"

    !!! info "What is a cloud fleet?"
        By default, when running dev environments, tasks, and services, `dstack` 
        reuses `idle` instances from existing fleets or creates a new cloud fleet on the fly.
        
        If you want more control over the lifecycle of cloud instances, you can create a cloud fleet manually. 
        This allows you to reuse a fleet over a longer period and across multiple runs. You can also delete the fleet only when needed.

    To create a cloud fleet, specify `resources`, `nodes`, 
    and other optional parameters.
    
    <div editor-title="examples/fine-tuning/alignment-handbook/fleet-distrib.dstack.yml">
    
    ```yaml
    type: fleet
    # The name is optional, if not specified, generated randomly
    name: ah-fleet-distrib
    
    # Size of the cluster
    nodes: 2
    # Ensure instances are interconnected
    placement: cluster
    
    # Use either spot or on-demand instances
    spot_policy: auto
    
    resources:
      gpu:
        # 24GB or more vRAM
        memory: 24GB..
        # One or more GPU
        count: 1..
    ```
    
    </div>
    
    When you apply this configuration, `dstack` will create cloud instances using the configured backends according 
    to the specified parameters.

    !!! info "Network"
        Set `placement` to `cluster` if the nodes should be interconnected
        (e.g. if you'd like to use them for [multi-node tasks](reference/dstack.yml/task.md#distributed-tasks)). 
        In that case, `dstack` will provision all nodes in the same backend and region and configure the optimal
        connectivity via availability zones, placement groups, etc.

    Note that cloud fleets aren't supported for the `kubernetes`, `vastai`, and `runpod` backends.

=== "SSH fleets"

    !!! info "What is an SSH fleet?"
        If youâ€™d like to run dev environments, tasks, and services on arbitrary on-prem servers via `dstack`, you can 
        create an SSH fleet.

    To create an SSH fleet, specify `ssh_config` to allow the `dstack` server to connect to these servers
    via SSH.

    <div editor-title="fleet-ssh.dstack.yml"> 
    
    ```yaml
    type: fleet
    # The name is optional, if not specified, generated randomly
    name: my-ssh-fleet

    # Ensure instances are interconnected
    placement: cluster

    # The user, private SSH key, and hostnames of the on-prem servers
    ssh_config:
      user: ubuntu
      identity_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      hosts:
        - 3.255.177.51
        - 3.255.177.52
    ```
    
    </div>

    When you apply this configuration, `dstack` will connect to the specified hosts using the provided SSH credentials, 
    install the dependencies, and configure these servers as a fleet.

    !!! info "Requirements" 
        Hosts should be pre-installed with Docker.

        === "NVIDIA"
            Systems with NVIDIA GPUs should also be pre-installed with CUDA 12.1 and
            [NVIDIA Container Toolkit :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

        === "AMD"
            Systems with AMD GPUs should also be pre-installed with AMDGPU-DKMS kernel driver (e.g. via
            [native package manager :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/native-install/index.html)
            or [AMDGPU installer :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/amdgpu-install.html).)

        The user should have passwordless `sudo` access.

    ??? info "Environment variables"
        For SSH fleets, it's possible to pre-configure environment variables. 
        These variables will be used when installing the `dstack-shim` service on hosts 
        and running containers.

        For example, these variables can be used to configure a proxy:

        ```yaml
        type: fleet
        name: my-fleet
        
        placement: cluster
        
        env:
          - HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80
          - HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80
          - NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1
        
        ssh_config:
          user: ubuntu
          identity_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
          hosts:
            - 3.255.177.51
            - 3.255.177.52
        ```

    !!! info "Network"
        Set `placement` to `cluster` if the hosts are interconnected
        (e.g. if you'd like to use them for [multi-node tasks](reference/dstack.yml/task.md#distributed-tasks)).
        In that case, by default, `dstack` will automatically detect the private network. 
        You can specify the [`network`](../reference/dstack.yml/fleet.md#network) parameter manually.

    Note that to use SSH fleets, you don't need any backends at all.

> See [`.dstack.yml`](../reference/dstack.yml/fleet.md) for all the options supported by
> the fleet configuration.

## Create or update a fleet

To create or update the fleet, simply call the [`dstack apply`](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-apply) command:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack apply -f examples/fine-tuning/alignment-handbook/fleet-distributed.dstack.yml
```

</div>

### Ensure the fleet is created

To ensure the fleet is created, use the `dstack fleet` command:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack fleet

 FLEET     INSTANCE  BACKEND              GPU             PRICE    STATUS  CREATED 
 my-fleet  0         gcp (europe-west-1)  L4:24GB (spot)  $0.1624  idle    3 mins ago      
           1         gcp (europe-west-1)  L4:24GB (spot)  $0.1624  idle    3 mins ago    
```

</div>

Once the status of instances changes to `idle`, they can be used by dev environments, tasks, and services.

### Troubleshooting SSH fleets

!!! info "Resources"
    If you're creating an SSH fleet, ensure that the GPU, memory, and disk size are detected properly.
    If GPU isn't detected, ensure that the hosts meet the requirements (see above).

If the status doesn't change to `idle` after a few minutes, ensure that 
the hosts meet the requirements (see above).

If the requirements are met but the fleet still fails to be created, check `/root/.dstack/shim.log` for logs 
on the hosts specified in `ssh_config`.

[//]: # (## Creation policy)

[//]: # (By default, when running dev environments, tasks, and services, `dstack apply` tries to reuse `idle` )
[//]: # (instances from existing fleets. )
[//]: # (If no `idle` instances meet the requirements, it creates a new fleet automatically.)
[//]: # (To avoid creating new fleet, specify pass `--reuse` to `dstack apply` or &#40;or set [)
[//]: # (`creation_policy`]&#40;../reference/dstack.yml/dev-environment.md#creation_policy&#41; to `reuse` in the configuration&#41;.)

## Manage fleets

### List fleets

The [`dstack fleet`](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-gateway-list) command lists fleet instances and theri status:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack fleet

 FLEET     INSTANCE  BACKEND              GPU             PRICE    STATUS  CREATED 
 my-fleet  0         gcp (europe-west-1)  L4:24GB (spot)  $0.1624  idle    3 mins ago      
           1         gcp (europe-west-1)  L4:24GB (spot)  $0.1624  idle    3 mins ago    
```

</div>

### Delete fleets

When a fleet isn't used by run, you can delete it via `dstack delete`:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack delete -f cluster.dstack.yaml
Delete the fleet my-gcp-fleet? [y/n]: y
Fleet my-gcp-fleet deleted
```

</div>

You can pass either the path to the configuration file or the fleet name directly.

To terminate and delete specific instances from a fleet, pass `-i INSTANCE_NUM`.

#### Termination policy

If you want a fleet to be automatically deleted after a certain idle time, you can set the
you can set the [`termination_idle_time`](../reference/dstack.yml/fleet.md#termination_idle_time) property.

[//]: # (Add Idle time example to the reference page)
