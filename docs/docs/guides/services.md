# Services

With `dstack`, you can use the CLI or API to deploy models or web apps.
Provide the commands, port, and choose the Python version or a Docker image.

`dstack` handles the deployment on configured cloud GPU provider(s) with the necessary resources.

??? info "Prerequisites"

    If you're using the open-source server, you first have to set up a gateway.

    ### Set up a gateway

    For example, if your domain is `example.com`, go ahead and run the 
    `dstack gateway create` command:
    
    <div class="termy">
       
    ```shell
    $ dstack gateway create --domain example.com --region eu-west-1 --backend aws
    
    Creating gateway...
    ---> 100%
    
     BACKEND  REGION     NAME          ADDRESS        DOMAIN       DEFAULT
     aws      eu-west-1  sour-fireant  52.148.254.14  example.com  âœ“
    ```
    
    </div>
    
    Afterward, in your domain's DNS settings, add an `A` DNS record for `*.example.com` 
    pointing to the IP address of the gateway.
    
    This way, if you run a service, `dstack` will make its endpoint available at 
    `https://<run-name>.example.com`.

If you're using the cloud version of `dstack`, the gateway is set up for you.

## Using the CLI

### Define a configuration

First, create a YAML file in your project folder. Its name must end with `.dstack.yml` (e.g. `.dstack.yml` or `train.dstack.yml`
are both acceptable).

<div editor-title="serve.dstack.yml"> 

```yaml
type: service

image: ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:latest

env: 
  - MODEL_ID=TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GPTQ 

port: 80

commands:
  - text-generation-launcher --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 80 --trust-remote-code
```

</div>

By default, `dstack` uses its own Docker images to run dev environments, 
which are pre-configured with Python, Conda, and essential CUDA drivers.

!!! info "Configuration options"
    Configuration file allows you to specify a custom Docker image, environment variables, and many other 
    options.
    For more details, refer to the [Reference](../reference/dstack.yml.md#service).

### Run the configuration

To run a configuration, use the `dstack run` command followed by the working directory path, 
configuration file path, and any other options (e.g., for requesting hardware resources).

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack run . -f serve.dstack.yml --gpu A100

</div>

Once the service is deployed, its endpoint will be available at
`https://<run-name>.<domain-name>` (using the domain [set up for the gateway](#set-up-a-gateway)).

!!! info "Run options"
    The `dstack run` command allows you to use `--gpu` to request GPUs (e.g. `--gpu A100` or `--gpu 80GB` or `--gpu A100:4`, etc.),
    and many other options (incl. spot instances, disk size, max price, max duration, retry policy, etc.).
    For more details, refer to the [Reference](../reference/cli/index.md#dstack-run).
