# Dev environments

A dev environment is a cloud instance pre-configured with an IDE.

!!! info "NOTE:"
    Dev environments are ideal when you want to interactively work with code using your favorite IDE.

## Define a configuration

To configure a dev environment, create its configuration file. It can be defined
in any folder but must be named with a suffix `.dstack.yml`.

<div editor-title=".dstack.yml"> 

```yaml
type: dev-environment

python: "3.11" # (Optional) If not specified, your local version is used.

setup: # (Optional) Executed once at the first startup.
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

ide: vscode
```

</div>

### Configure the environment

By default, `dstack` uses its own Docker images to run dev environments, which are pre-configured with Python, Conda, and essential CUDA drivers.

You can install packages using `pip` and `conda` executables from `setup`.

??? info "Docker image (experimental)"
    If you prefer to use your custom Docker image, use the `image` property in the configuration.

    However, this requires your image to have `openssh-server` pre-installed. If you want to use a custom Docker
    image with a dev environment and it does not include `openssh-server`, you can install it using the following 
    method:

    <div editor-title=".dstack.yml">

    ```yaml
    type: dev-environment
    
    image: ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:0.9
    
    build:
      - apt-get update
      - DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y openssh-server
      - rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
 
    ide: vscode
    ```

    </div>

??? info "Build command (experimental)" 

    In case you'd like to pre-build the environment rather than install packaged on every run,
    you can use the `build` property. Here's an example:
    
    <div editor-title=".dstack.yml"> 
    
    ```yaml
    type: dev-environment

    python: "3.11" # (Optional) If not specified, your local version is used.
    
    build:
      - pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
    
    ide: vscode
    ```
    
    </div>

    In this case, you have to pass `--build` to `dstack run`.

    <div class="termy">
    
    ```shell
    $ dstack run . --build
    ```
    
    </div>

    If there is no pre-built image, the `dstack run` command will build it and upload it to the storage. If the pre-built
    image is already available, the `dstack run` command will reuse it.

For more details on the file syntax, refer to [`.dstack.yml`](../reference/dstack.yml/dev-environment.md).

## Run the configuration

To run a dev environment, use the `dstack run` command followed by the path to the directory you want to use as the
working directory.

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack run . 

 RUN          CONFIGURATION   BACKEND  RESOURCES        SPOT  PRICE
 fast-moth-1  app.dstack.yml  aws      5xCPUs, 15987MB  yes   $0.0547 
 
Provisioning and starting SSH tunnel...
---> 100%

To open in VS Code Desktop, use this link:
  vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+fast-moth-1/workflow
```

</div>

The `dstack run` command provisions cloud resources, pre-installs the environment, code, and the IDE, and establishes an
SSH tunnel for secure access. 

To open the dev environment via a desktop IDE, click the URL in the output.

By default, VS Code comes with pre-installed Python and Jupyter extensions.

### Requesting resources

You can request resources using the [`--gpu`](../reference/cli/run.md#GPU) 
and [`--memory`](../reference/cli/run.md#MEMORY) arguments with `dstack run`, 
or through [`resources`](../reference/profiles.yml.md#RESOURCES) with `.dstack/profiles.yml`.

Both the [`dstack run`](../reference/cli/run.md) command and [`.dstack/profiles.yml`](../reference/profiles.yml.md)
support various other options, including requesting spot instances, defining the maximum run duration or price, and
more.

!!! info "Automatic instance discovery"
    `dstack` will automatically select the suitable instance type from a cloud provider and region with the best
    price and availability.

For more details on the run command, refer to [`dstack run`](../reference/cli/run.md).
