# dstack Sky

If you don't want to host the `dstack` server or would like to access GPU from the `dstack` marketplace, 
sign up with [dstack Sky](../guides/dstack-sky.md).

### Set up the CLI

If you've signed up, open your project settings, and copy the `dstack config` command to point the CLI to the project.

Then, install the CLI on your machine and use the copied command.

```shell
$ pip install dstack
$ dstack config --url https://sky.dstack.ai \
    --project peterschmidt85 \
    --token bbae0f28-d3dd-4820-bf61-8f4bb40815da
    
Configuration is updated at ~/.dstack/config.yml
```

### Configure clouds

By default, [dstack Sky :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://sky.dstack.ai){:target="_blank"} 
uses the GPU from its marketplace, which requires a credit card to be attached in your account
settings.

To use your own cloud accounts, click the settings icon of the corresponding backend and specify credentials:

For more details on how to configure your own cloud accounts, check
the [server/config.yml reference](../reference/server/config.yml.md).
