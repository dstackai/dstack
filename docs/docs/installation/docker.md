# Docker

Here's how to run the `dstack` server via Docker:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ docker run --name dstack -p &lt;port-on-host&gt;:3000 \ 
  -v ~/.dstack/server:/root/.dstack/server \
  dstackai/dstack
```

</div>

!!! info "Configure clouds"
    Upon startup, the server sets up the default project called `main`. Prior to using `dstack`, you must log in to the
    UI, open the project's settings, and configure cloud backends (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda Cloud, etc.).

## Environment variables

Here's the list of environment variables which you can override:

- `DSTACK_SERVER_ADMIN_TOKEN` – (Optional) The default token of the `admin` user. By default, it's generated randomly
  at the first startup.
- `DSTACK_SERVER_DATA` – (Optional) The path to the directory where the `dstack`server stores the state. Defaults to `~/.dstack/server`.

## Persisting state in a cloud storage

By default, `dstack` saves state in a local directory (see `DSTACK_SERVER_DATA`).
If you want to persist state automatically to a cloud object storage, you can configure the following environment
variables.

- `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_URL` - The url of the cloud object storage.
  Examples: `s3://<bucket-name>/<path>`, `gcs://<bucket-name>/<path>`, `abs://<storage-account>@<container-name>/<path>`, etc.

??? info "AWS S3"
    To persist state into an AWS S3 bucket, provide the following environment variables:

    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - The AWS access key ID
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` -  The AWS secret access key

??? info "GCP Storage"
    To persist state into an AWS S3 bucket, provide one of the following environment variables:

    - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - The path to the GCP service account key JSON file
    - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` - The GCP service account key JSON

??? info "Azure Blob Storage"
    To persist state into an Azure blog storage, provide the following environment variable.

    - `LITESTREAM_AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY` - The Azure storage account key
