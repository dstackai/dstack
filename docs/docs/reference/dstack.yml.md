# .dstack.yml

Configurations are YAML files that describe what you want to run with `dstack`. Configurations can be of three
types: `dev-environment`, `task`, and `service`.

!!! info "Filename"
    The configuration file must be named with the suffix `.dstack.yml`. For example,
    you can name the configuration file `.dstack.yml` or `app.dstack.yml`. You can define
    these configurations anywhere within your project. 
    
    Each folder may have one default configuration file named `.dstack.yml`.
