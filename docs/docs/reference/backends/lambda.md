# Lambda Cloud

The `Lambda` backend allows provisioning infrastructure in Lambda Cloud while storing state and 
artifacts in an S3 bucket.

Follow the step-by-step guide below to configure a project with this backend.

## 1. Set up an S3 storage

As Lambda Cloud doesn't have its own object storage, `dstack` requires you to specify an S3 bucket, 
along with AWS credentials, for storing state and artifacts.

### 1.1. Create an S3 bucket

First, you need to create an S3 bucket. `dstack` will use this bucket to store state and artifacts.

### 1.2. Create an IAM user

The next step is to [create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) and grant this user permissions to perform actions on the `s3` service.

??? info "Logs and secrets"
    If you want `dstack` to also store logs and secrets, you can optionally grant permissions 
    to the `logs` and `secretsmanager` services.

### 1.3. Create an access key

To create an access key,
[follow this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html#cli-authentication-user-get). Once the access key is created, make sure to download the `.csv` file containing your IAM user's
`Access key ID` and `Secret access key`.

## 2. Set up API key

Then, you'll need a Lambda Cloud API key. Log into your Lambda Cloud account, click `API keys` in the sidebar, and then
click the `Generate API key` button to create a new API key.

## 3. Create a project

There is not yet a possibility to create a Lambda project via the UI. Currently, you can only create a Lambda project
through an API request. Please use the snippet below to create a Lambda project.

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/projects' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer &lt;your dstack token&gt;' \
      -d '{
          	"project_name": "lambda",
          	"backend": {
          		"type": "lambda",
          		"regions": ["us-west-1"],
          		"api_key": "&lt;your Lambda API key&gt;",
          		"storage_backend": {
          			"type": "aws",
          			"credentials": {
          				"access_key": "&lt;your AWS access key&gt;",
          				"secret_key": "&lt;your AWS secret key&gt;"
          			},
          			"bucket_name": "&lt;your S3 bucket name&gt;"
          		}
          	},
          	"members": []
          }'
```

</div>

!!! info "NOTE:"
    Ensure that you use your `dstack` token, your Lambda API key, your AWS access key, and your S3 bucket name.

## 4. Configure the CLI

!!! info "NOTE:"
    Once you have created the project, feel free to use the CLI code snippet to configure it for use with the created project.
