# Fleets

Fleets enable efficient provisioning and management of clusters and instances, both in the cloud and on-prem. Once a
fleet is created, it can be reused by dev environments, tasks, and services.

## Define a configuration

To create a fleet, create a YAML file in your project folder. Its name must end with `.dstack.yml` (e.g. `.dstack.yml` or `fleet.dstack.yml`
are both acceptable).

=== "Cloud fleets"

    To provision a fleet in the cloud using the configured backends, specify the required resources, number of nodes, 
    and other optional parameters.
    
    <div editor-title="examples/fine-tuning/alignment-handbook/fleet-distrib.dstack.yml">
    
    ```yaml
    type: fleet
    # The name is optional, if not specified, generated randomly
    name: ah-fleet-distrib
    
    # Size of the cluster
    nodes: 2
    # Ensure instances are interconnected
    placement: cluster
    
    # Use either spot or on-demand instances
    spot_policy: auto
    
    resources:
      gpu:
        # 24GB or more vRAM
        memory: 24GB..
        # One or more GPU
        count: 1..
    ```
    
    </div>

    Set `placement` to `cluster` if the nodes should be interconnected (e.g. if you'd like to use them for multi-node tasks). 
    In that case, `dstack` will provision all nodes in the same backend and region.
    
    Defining fleets with YAML isn't supported yet for the `kubernetes`, `vastai`, and `runpod` backends.

=== "On-prem fleets"

    To create a fleet from on-prem servers, specify their hosts along with the user, port, and SSH key for connection via SSH.

    <div editor-title="fleet-on-prem.dstack.yml"> 
    
    ```yaml
    type: fleet
    # The name is optional, if not specified, generated randomly
    name: my-on-prem-fleet

    # Ensure instances are interconnected
    placement: cluster

    # The user, private SSH key, and hostnames of the on-prem servers
    ssh_config:
      user: ubuntu
      identity_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      hosts:
        - 3.255.177.51
        - 3.255.177.52
    ```
    
    </div>

    !!! warning "Requirements"
        On-prem servers should be pre-installed with Docker.
        Systems with NVIDIA GPUs should also be pre-installed with CUDA 12.1 and
        [NVIDIA Container Toolkit :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).
        The user should have `sudo` access.

    ??? info "Environment variables"
        For on-prem fleets, it's possible to pre-configure environment variables. 
        These variables will be used when installing the `dstack-shim` service on hosts 
        and running containers.

        For example, these variables can be used to configure a proxy:

        ```yaml
        type: fleet
        name: my-fleet
        
        placement: cluster
        
        env:
          - HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80
          - HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80
          - NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1
        
        ssh_config:
          user: ubuntu
          identity_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
          hosts:
            - 3.255.177.51
            - 3.255.177.52
        ```

    Set `placement` to `cluster` if the nodes are interconnected (e.g. if you'd like to use them for multi-node tasks).
    In that case, by default, `dstack` will automatically detect the private network. 
    You can specify the [`network`](reference/dstack.yml/fleet.md#network) parameter manually.

!!! info "Reference"
    See [.dstack.yml](reference/dstack.yml/fleet.md) for all the options supported by
    fleets, along with multiple examples.

## Create or update a fleet

To create or update the fleet, simply call the [`dstack apply`](reference/cli/index.md#dstack-apply) command:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack apply -f examples/fine-tuning/alignment-handbook/fleet-distributed.dstack.yml
Fleet ah-fleet-distrib does not exist yet. Create the fleet? [y/n]: y

 FLEET     INSTANCE  BACKEND  RESOURCES  PRICE  STATUS   CREATED 
 my-fleet  0                                    pending  now     
           1                                    pending  now     
```

</div>

Once the status of instances change to `idle`, they can be used by dev environments, tasks, and services.

## Creation policy

By default, when running dev environments, tasks, and services, `dstack apply` tries to reuse `idle` 
instances from existing fleets. 
If no `idle` instances meet the requirements, it creates a new fleet automatically.
To avoid creating new fleet, specify pass `--reuse` to `dstack apply` or (or set [
`creation_policy`](reference/dstack.yml/dev-environment.md#creation_policy) to `reuse` in the configuration).

## Termination policy

> If you want a fleet to be automatically deleted after a certain idle time, you can set the
> you can set the [`termination_idle_time`](reference/dstack.yml/fleet.md#termination_idle_time) property.

[//]: # (Add Idle time example to the reference page)

## Manage fleets

### List fleets

The [`dstack fleet`](reference/cli/index.md#dstack-gateway-list) command lists fleet instances and theri status:

<div class="termy">

```
$ dstack fleet
 FLEET     INSTANCE  BACKEND              GPU             PRICE    STATUS  CREATED 
 my-fleet  0         gcp (europe-west-1)  L4:24GB (spot)  $0.1624  idle    3 mins ago      
           1         gcp (europe-west-1)  L4:24GB (spot)  $0.1624  idle    3 mins ago    
```

</div>

### Delete fleets

When a fleet isn't used by run, you can delete it via `dstack delete`:

<div class="termy">

```shell
$ dstack delete -f cluster.dstack.yaml
Delete the fleet my-gcp-fleet? [y/n]: y
Fleet my-gcp-fleet deleted
```

</div>

You can pass either the path to the configuration file or the fleet name directly.

To terminate and delete specific instances from a fleet, pass `-i INSTANCE_NUM`.
