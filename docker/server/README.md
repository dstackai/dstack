`dstack` is a streamlined alternative to Kubernetes, specifically designed for AI. It simplifies container orchestration
for AI workloads both in the cloud and on-prem, speeding up the development, training, and deployment of AI models.

`dstack` supports `NVIDIA GPU`, `AMD GPU`, and `Google Cloud TPU` out of the box.

## Configure backends

To use `dstack` with your own cloud accounts, create the `~/.dstack/server/config.yml` file and 
[configure backends](https://dstack.ai/docs/reference/server/config.yml).

## Start the server

Starting the `dstack` server via Docker can be done the following way:

```shell
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v $HOME/.dstack/server/:/root/.dstack/server dstackai/dstack

The dstack server is running at http://0.0.0.0:3000
The admin user token is 'bbae0f28-d3dd-4820-bf61-8f4bb40815da'
```

For more details on server configuration options, see the
[server deployment](https://dstack.ai/docs/guides/server-deployment.md) guide.

## Set up the CLI

To point the CLI to the `dstack` server, configure it
with the server address, user token, and project name:

```shell
$ pip install dstack
$ dstack config --url http://127.0.0.1:3000 \
    --project main \
    --token bbae0f28-d3dd-4820-bf61-8f4bb40815da
    
Configuration is updated at ~/.dstack/config.yml
```

## Create SSH fleets
    
If you want the `dstack` server to run containers on your on-prem servers,
use [fleets](https://dstack.ai/docs/concepts/fleets#ssh).
